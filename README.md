# Eye-Controlled Mouse Using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37646abd-f042-4ce8-8eb9-614bc88eb816

This project implements an eye-controlled mouse using real-time video capture from a webcam, facial landmark detection with MediaPipe, and mouse control using PyAutoGUI. The script detects the user's eye movements and blinks to control the mouse cursor and perform clicks.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `opencv-python`
- `mediapipe`
- `pyautogui`

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui
```

DroidCam is an application that allows users to use their Android or iOS device as a wireless webcam for their PC. It can be particularly useful for projects that require a webcam but where a dedicated USB webcam might not be available,
Search for "Droid Cam" and install on both the devices (Laptop and phone) and connect them.
